# R Companion to 

### Ken Train's *Discrete Choice Methods with Simulation*

This is a work in progress and (quite obviously) is extremely preliminary.

The intent is to provide a companion manuscript to Kenneth Train's wonderful book (the 2009 second edition), which will demonstrate the statistical computations in the R Programming Language.
