> You don't understand it, until you have coded it.

It's a mantra that my mentors instilled in me in graduate school, and one that I propogate on my students today. I believe it in deeply. If you want to understand a statistical model, it is insufficient to interact with the model only through pen and paper, no matter how well you organize the subscripts or how masterfully you interweave elements of the Greek and Roman alphabets. To really understand a statistical model, you need to be able to simulate data from the model, and then take that simulated data to an estimation routine that enables you to recover the parameters of interest. 

This is something you learn to do in graduate school. But no one teaches it to you! Instead, it's a skill that students develop independently and inefficiently between classes and assignment due dates. There is a tremendous imbalance between how immensely important this skill is and the lack of time and instruction dedicated to it.[^1] That imbalance is the motivation for this book.

[^1]: What I'm talking about is the field of statistical computing. My experience was that graduate students in economics, psychology, and business had little, if any, formal exposure to these ideas. For a related text that emphasizes computational statistics, see @rizzo2019; and for a Bayesian perspective, see the "Bayesian Workflow" ideas @mcelreath2018.

## How to read this book

As the title suggests, the structure, topics, and organization of this book parallel Kenneth Train's masterful text _Discrete Choice Methods with Simulation_ (Second Edition) freely available online at <https://eml.berkeley.edu/books/choice2.html>. 

You should read --- or most likely, re-read --- one chapter from @train2009 and then read and work through the corresponding chapter here, alternating between our texts. Do not simply read this book from start to finish without frequenly returning to @train2009. Doing so only deprives you of the intended experience and likely dramatically reduces the amount you will learn from the process. 

In addition, I strongly encourage you write or copy the code as you work though this book. I would mandate this if I could, but I'm not sitting there next to you and so I must settle for simply sharing my encouragement. Write the code. Play with the code. Break the code. Make it your own. That behavior is where deep understanding comes from, not from highlighting the occasional sentence or equation you find important.

## Prerequisites

This book is intended for a narrow audience, predominently graduate students with an interest in discrete choice modelling who will find value from seeing and interacting with the programmatic implementation of the multinomial logit and its extended family of related models. In other words, someone who read @train2009 and thought "how would I code that?"

I assume you are reasonably familiar with R, a freely available software environment for statistical computing and graphics. I also assume you have taken statistics or econometrics courses that introduced the method of maximum likelihood, Bayesian statistics, and limited dependent variable regression models.
