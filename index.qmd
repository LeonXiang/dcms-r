> You don't understand it, until you have coded it.

It's a mantra that my mentors instilled in me in graduate school, and one that I propogate on my students today. I believe it in deeply. If you want to understand a statistical model, it is insufficient to interact with the model only through pen and paper, no matter how well you organize the subscripts or how masterfully you interweave elements of the Greek and Roman alphabets. To really understand a statistical model, you need to be able to simulate data from the model, and then take that simulated data to an estimation routine that enables you to recover the parameters of interest. 

This is something you learn to do in graduate school. But no one teaches it to you! Instead, it's a skill that students develop independently and inefficiently between classes and assignment due dates. There is a tremendous imbalance between how immensely important this skill is and the lack of time and instruction dedicated to it.[^1] That imbalance is the motivation for this book.

Indeed, Train and I align in our thinking: "Whenever appropriate, researchers should use availabale codes rather than writing their own. However, the true value of the new approach to choice modeling is the ability to create tailor-made models. The computation and programming steps that are needed to implement a new model are usually not difficult. An important goal of the book is to teach these skills as an integral part of the exposition of the models themselves." To that end, Train provides pseudo-code throughout his book and makes Matlab code available on his website. This text takes it a step further. 

What is "not that difficult" for an experienced researcher can be immensely difficult for a typical graduate student. The aim of this book is to ease that difficulty. I demonstrate R code alongside the math. You will see Train's pseudo-code transformed into working R code. No mysteries will remain. To quote Quintilian, Cobbett, Cooke, and many others: my goal is to take you through the process of programming the simulation and estimation of discrete choice models not so that you can understand, but so that you cannot possibly misunderstand.

[^1]: What I'm talking about is the field of _statistical computing_. My experience was that graduate students in economics, psychology, and business had little, if any, formal exposure to these ideas. For a related text that emphasizes computational statistics, see @rizzo2019; and for a Bayesian perspective, see the "Bayesian Workflow" ideas @mcelreath2018.


## How to read this book

As the title suggests, the structure, topics, and organization of this book parallel Kenneth Train's masterful text _Discrete Choice Methods with Simulation_ (Second Edition) freely available online at <https://eml.berkeley.edu/books/choice2.html>. 

You should read --- or most likely, re-read --- one chapter from @train2009 and then read and work through the corresponding chapter here, alternating between our texts. Do not simply read this book from start to finish without frequenly returning to @train2009. Doing so only deprives you of the intended experience and likely dramatically reduces the amount you will learn from the process. 

In addition, I strongly encourage you write or copy the code as you work though this book. I would mandate this if I could, but I'm not sitting there next to you and so I must settle for simply sharing my encouragement. Write the code. Play with the code. Break the code. Make it your own. That behavior is where deep understanding comes from, not from highlighting the occasional sentence or equation you find important.

## Prerequisites

This book is intended for a narrow audience, predominently graduate students with an interest in discrete choice modelling who will find value from seeing and interacting with the programmatic implementation of the multinomial logit and its extended family of related models. In other words, someone who read @train2009 and thought _how would I code that?_

I assume you are reasonably familiar with R, a freely available software environment for statistical computing and graphics. I also assume you have taken statistics or econometrics courses that introduced the method of maximum likelihood, Bayesian statistics, and limited dependent variable regression models. You don't need to be an expert in these methods or models, but I assume you have at least encountered them before.

## Acknowledgments

I am immensely greatful to the teams that work on the R-Project, those at Posit who provide RStudio and Quarto, and the related communities of developers, academics, and R users. The free tools they provide and the welcoming communities they have established are both exceptional.

I also thank my academic mentors Ella Honka, Peter Rossi, Eric Bradlow, and (although we have yet to meet) Kenneth Train as well as the folks that tolerate me through my consulting work, including Prachi Bhalerao, June Wu, Chris Diener, and Keith Chrzan. I have learned so much from their guidance and often their written work. 

Unquestionably, my deepest thanks go to Alison, Zach, and Ben for their patience and support.
