### Ken Train's Discrete Choice Methods with Simulation

This is a work in progress and (quite obviously) is extremely preliminary.

The intent is to provide a companion manuscript to Kenneth Train's wonderful book *Discrete Choice Modeling with Simulation* (the 2009 second edition).  
This companion will demonstrate the statistical computations Train's book in the R Programming Language.
